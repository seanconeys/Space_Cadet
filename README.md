# Space Cadet
Sean Coneys and Ori Ancari

Space Cadet is a retro style arcade game where the player controls a spaceship using a stering wheel and gas pedal (a modified potentiometer and handmade button hooked up to an arduino). The player attempts to dodge asteroids while collecting planets as the difficulty scales. As an added bonus it uses the computer's webcam to provide a live image of the player inside the spaceship.
